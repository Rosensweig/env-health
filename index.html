			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><h5>What is "Adjusted Air Quality Index"? What does it mean for living here and breathing the air daily?</h5>
					<p>If you're seeing positive numbers, you're probably okay, but ideal is above 50. If you're seeing negative numbers regularly, for any measured parameter, see if you can do something about it! I've provided historical data as well, so that you can put your current air quality in perspective over time.</p>
					<p><span class="quality-1"> 50 to 100 = Good </span><br>
					<span class="quality-2"> 0 to 49 = Moderate </span><br>
					<span class="quality-3"> -50 to -1 = Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups </span><br>
					<span class="quality-4"> -100 to -51 = Unhealthy </span><br>
					<span class="quality-5"> -200 to -101 = Very Unhealthy </span><br>
					<span class="quality-6"> -400 to -201 = Hazardous </span></p>

					<p>Adjusted Air Quality Index is based on a more official figure, <a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi">Air Quality Index</a> (AQI), but AQI goes up when air quality is worse, and down when air quality is better. This seemed counter-intuitive, and I'm aiming this at everyday people (not those who know much about air quality), so I reversed it. Higher numbers mean better air quality. If you want to translate from displayed AAQI to the more official AQI figures, use: 100-AAQI = AQI.</p>
				</li>

				<li><h5>What are the different parameters measured? Why should I care about them?</h5>
					<p><a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqiguideozone">Ozone (O3)</a> in the stratosphere protects us from ultraviolet radiation, but it can cause coughing or lung damage when we breathe it in. Ozone forms near ground level when some pollutants react with sunlight, so it's worse in the afternoon and early evening than morning and overnight.</p>

					<p><a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.particle">PM2.5 and PM10</a> are particle pollution, or in layman's terms, any little things that float in the air. PM2.5 measures particles below 2.5 micrometers in diameter, too small to be seen by human eyes, but produced by a variety of industrial processes, wood burning, cars, and more. PM10 measures larger particles, like dust, pollen, and mold. These can result in anything from irritated eyes/nose/throat or coughing to heart attacks, but particularly affect children and the elderly, and those with heart or lung diseases.</p>
				</li>

				<li><h5>Where does your data come from?</h5>
					<p>Currently, all charted data comes from <a href="https://airnow.gov/">AirNow</a>, a service of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
				</li>

				<li><h5>What areas do you cover? Will you cover my area soon?</h5>
					<p>Currently, this covers the United States only. I originally envisioned the project working worldwide, but worldwide data was not easily accessible. I may still extend it some day, but it's a difficult task patching together data from many sources, likely in different formats, and it would still have holes where data is just not available. If you're in the US and no data pops up, try another nearby zipcode. It searches for recording stations within 25 miles of the zip code you submit.</p>
				</li>

				<li><h5>Who are you? Can I contact you, hire you, makes suggestions, or contribute to the project?</h5>
					<p>I'm Daniel Rosensweig, currently studying web development with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. This is the first of three portfolio projects I'll create before I graduate. I'm also a professional singer, musician, and music teacher in the Boston area, with a BA in Music from Williams College. And, as you might guess, I'm particularly interested in the environment and protecting our natural world. I'm seeking full stack web development opportunities, and I'm capable in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node, React, Python, and Java so far, and the list is growing. Feel free to contact me about this project or new opportunities (no spam please), at <a href="mailto:daniel.rosensweig@gmail.com">daniel.rosensweig@gmail.com</a>.</p>
